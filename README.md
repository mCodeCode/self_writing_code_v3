# self_writing_code_v3
self writing code with output to a canvas (useful to visualize the memory and the patterns that emerge)

# don't make prs to this, fork or whathever
the idea is that this repo will remain as it is, because its just another prototype version

# how to use?
git clone, open the html file in a browser and watch the patterns emerge.

# 
press f5 (reload the page) if the pattern is not interesting to you
# 
press q to stop the program (check console output to see the rules created by the program itself,
check the code to see how to recreate the program with old rules).
# 
this is a prototype, you  will notice that some features were not implemented yet (but this is cool enough to share as it is)
